# so_long
so_long is our first graphic project at 42 in which we have to create our own 2D game! We are free to choose the textures of our game, as long as it contains a player, collectibles, and an exit.

The objective of the game is to catch all the collectibles and then take the exit, nothing very clever, but you have to start with something!\
To do this, the player must be able to move in all directions without running into the walls. He can't get out without collecting all the collectibles. Of course, before all that you have to check that the map given as a parameter does not contain any errors.\
It is funny to add some animations when the player moves, when he can get out (the exit becomes green hehe), or a movement counter (top right).


Here is what my game looks like (watch out, graphics are not my forte) :

## Try it! (must be on macOS)
First, use `git` to clone my game into the directory of your choice. 
`	git clone https://github.com/passionroro/42cursus-so_long.git`

Next, `cd` (_change directory_) into 42cursus-so_long
    `cd 42cursus-so_long`
  
You can now : 
 - compile all the files :
 `make`
 - run the game :
 `./so_long maps/map.ber`

Enjoy!
